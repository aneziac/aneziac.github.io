This is a demo site built entirely using Congo. It also contains a complete set of [theme documentation].

In order for this to work, simply include the [katex shortcode] in the article. Any KaTeX syntax on that page will then be automatically rendered.\nUse the online reference of supported TeX functions for the available syntax.\nInline notation #Inline notation can be generated by wrapping the expression in \\\\( and \\\\) delimiters.\nExample:\n% KaTeX inline notation Inline notation: \\\\(\\varphi = \\dfrac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887…\\\\) Inline notation: \\(\\varphi = \\dfrac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887…\\)\nBlock notation #Alternatively, block notation can be generated using $$ delimiters.
